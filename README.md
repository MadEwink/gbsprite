## About the project

I love programming languages, and games, and the game boy was one of my first consoles.
Developping a game boy game is a dream of mine, and I thought it would be usefull to have a tool to ease the export of sprites, so I tried to do my own.
This is also a way for me to practice HTML, CSS and JavaScript, since I clearly lack of practice and like to get better at it.
